# srcMainFirstProject
GUI Part of FirstProject

-SRCMain is my main class with my main function;

-LogInPane is my Log in page;
->
-JobSelection is the next page if you sucessfully log in through LogInPane;
-JobSelection has Job sub-class folders that it pulls methods from;
-JobInformationIndex houses all the main Job Data.

- I have a lot of commented patches of code that make no sense. Ignore them. Theyre just references and have nothing to do with the actual program unless specified. I should have cleaned it up before uploading on github. It was an oversight.
